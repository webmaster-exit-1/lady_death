## Description

Lady Death (also known as the Stainless Steel Armadillo) is the original source code from the 90's Australian virus development scene. <br>
Created by Dark Fiber from the NuKE group in 1995, this is authentic MS-DOS assembly code from the underground virus research community. <br>
Originally discovered in either the depths of VX Underground or the vast Phrack archives, this code is a relic from the past. <br>
